Object-oriented programming can be used to model many real-world environments. In this lab you will model players from a battle between the Righteous Rock Rollers, the Savvy Scissor Slingers, and the Postulating Paper Pushers.  The players you create will compete against one another in games of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
