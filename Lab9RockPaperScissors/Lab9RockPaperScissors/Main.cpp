//Description: This application manages the inventory of a car lot, this is done by using a car class to manage all the differnt cars in the system 
//test case #1: I enter 2 and all the current inventory is displayed and I am routed back to the main screen
//test case #2: I enter 5 and am prompted to enter the name of a car to paint, if the car is in the system then I choose what color and then that color is updated, and the price goes up by 1000
//test case #3 I enter 7 and I am prompted for the name of the file I want to save and then the current inventory is saved to the file.
